Once the js files have been changed and confirmed please replace "seat-selection-mini.js" using this website: https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/

************ UPDATE **********************
13/02/2017 - Strange bug found around multi-select using this tool. Now use the following website to minify: https://jscompress.com/

1. Paste RaphaelSeatSelectionDragSelect.js into the text box and then underneath the text paste the following files:
- RaphaelSeatSelectionSeating.js
- RaphaelSeatSelectionStadium.js
- RaphaelSeatSelectionZoom.js
- stand-and-area-selection.js
in the correct order
2. Copy the compressed version
3. Paste the code into seat-selection-mini.js
